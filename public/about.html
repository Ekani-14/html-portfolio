<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Ekani refers to a leaf detaching from a tree and being carried away by a
  stream. Throughout its journey, it doesn't resist the water's power but rather
  embraces and utilizes it with grace and dexterity, continually reinventing
  itself and becoming one with the current.

<p>
  This metaphor perfectly encapsulates my approach to design. With passion and a
  profound sense of freedom, I view design as akin to this leaf-drawing energy
  and inspiration from its environment, adapting, and daring to break away from
  the ordinary, much like a river overflowing its banks. Design is not merely a
  science or a philosophy; to me, it is life itself. The universe, in its act of
  creation and shaping of the world, had design as its ever-present companion.

  As a designer deeply passionate about both programming and Design, I
  seamlessly merge my love for Design with my technical skills. For the past 11
  years, I have dedicated myself to crafting unique, intuitive, and memorable
  user experiences. I embrace a wide variety of projects, whether they involve
  websites, mobile applications, or products, ensuring meticulous attention
  throughout the entire design and production cycle. My work is driven by a
  commitment to innovation and a desire to create designs that resonate deeply
  with users, providing them with exceptional experiences that stand the test of
  time.
